We used the UML diagram from chapter 10.5 in the book to write the Java code for the Course class.

We then wrote the java code in the Main.java file to instantiate a Course object and call some of its methods. Then, we added some names to the Array of students and printed the number of students to make sure the data field incremented correctly.
